This Python code is a script that performs the merging of data from two Excel files into the first file. It uses the openpyxl library to work with Excel files. Let's break down how the code works:
Import necessary libraries:
pathlib is used for working with file paths.
os.system is used to clear the console screen for a cleaner display.
os.listdir is used to list files in the current directory.
openpyxl is used for reading and writing Excel files.

Define the merge_2_excel_files() function:This function is the main part of the script, responsible for merging two Excel files.
It prompts the user to input the names of two Excel files they want to merge.
It loads both files using openpyxl, gets their active sheets, and checks if they have the same number of rows and columns.
If the files have different dimensions, it displays an error message and exits the program.
If the files have the same dimensions, it proceeds to compare the cell values in both sheets.
It tracks any cells with different data between the two files and merges the non-empty cells from the second file into the first.
If there were cells with different data, it prints a message indicating which cells were different.
Finally, it saves the merged data to a new Excel file named "Merge Result File.xlsx" and informs the user that the merge was successful.

Define the excel_file_name_input() function:This function is used to interact with the user to select an Excel file.
It displays a list of Excel files in the current directory and asks the user to choose one by entering the corresponding file number.
If there are no Excel files or only one Excel file in the directory, it displays an error message and exits the program.
The function returns the selected file name.

Define the num_to_col_letter() function:This function converts a column number (e.g., 1 for column A, 2 for column B) to its corresponding letter representation (e.g., 'A', 'B') used in Excel.

The script calls the merge_2_excel_files() function at the end, which initiates the merging process.

The script is designed to merge two Excel files with the same dimensions, and if there are cells with different data between the two files, it prioritizes the data from the first file. The merged data is saved to a new Excel file in the current directory.
