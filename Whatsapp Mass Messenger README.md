This Python code automates sending messages on WhatsApp Web using the Selenium library. It also interacts with Excel files using the openpyxl library and displays a message dialog using the tkinter library. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Importing Libraries:
   - `selenium`: This library is used for web automation and provides a WebDriver to control a web browser.
   - `openpyxl`: It allows reading and writing Excel files (xlsx).
   - `pyautogui`: This library provides functions for simulating user input, like keyboard typing and mouse clicks.
   - `time`: The `sleep` function is used to introduce delays in the script.
   - `tkinter`: This library is used for creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to display a message.

2. `message(msg)` Function:
   - This function creates a simple message dialog using tkinter to display a message. It is called at the end of the script to inform the user that messages have been sent.

3. Reading Data from an Excel File:
   - It opens an Excel file named "details.xlsx" using `openpyxl` and loads the active sheet.
   - The script assumes that the Excel file contains data, including phone numbers in column B and messages in column C.

4. Initializing Selenium WebDriver:
   - It creates an instance of the Chrome WebDriver using `webdriver.Chrome()`.
   - Navigates to the WhatsApp Web URL.

5. Waiting for WhatsApp Web to Load:
   - It enters a loop to wait for WhatsApp Web to load fully. This is done by trying to find an element with the text "WhatsApp Web" and waiting until it's found.

6. Sending Messages:
   - A loop iterates through rows in the Excel sheet, starting from row 2 (i=2).
   - It reads the phone number from column B.
   - It finds the search bar on WhatsApp Web and simulates typing the phone number into it using `pyautogui`.
   - It then simulates pressing the 'Enter' key.
   - It locates the most recent chat in the chat list (likely the one corresponding to the contact just searched) and clicks on it.
   - It finds the message input field, types the message from column C, and presses 'Enter' to send the message.

7. Displaying a Success Message:
   - After sending all messages, the `message("Messages Sent successfully!")` function is called to display a message to the user.

8. Closing Resources:
   - The Excel file is closed using `details.close()`.
   - The Chrome WebDriver is closed using `driver.quit()`.

Keep in mind that you'll need to have the necessary Chrome WebDriver installed and set up properly, and you should make sure that the structure of the Excel file matches the code's expectations (i.e., phone numbers in column B and messages in column C). Also, note that automating actions on WhatsApp Web may violate WhatsApp's terms of service, so be sure to use this script responsibly and within any legal or ethical constraints.
